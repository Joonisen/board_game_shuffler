# board_game_shuffler
First SQL school project, just to learn the intricacies of databases.
The main idea of this database is web scraping a lot of data from boardgamegeek.com and making use of it through an app. 
Maybe I'll create a web scraping script and some mockup app in the future!
Some search queries are quite odd, I wrote them mostly for experimentation.

Here's some info of the mockup app:
This is an app made for anyone interested in finding a suitable board game for any kind of situation.
The app’s database contains info on all board games ever made (web scraped from boardgamegeek.com, so someone else did that work, heh)
You can create your own lists of board games, e.g. what games you own, or by category, e.g. deck-building games or co-operative games etc.
It’s interface would allow you to input which games you have available to play, how many people are going to play, how much time you have, and how complex of a game you would like to play. The app will then give you examples of board games according to your criteria.
The idea is to minimize the hassle of trying to remember which games can be played with, for example, 6 people or maybe finding a less complex game to play with kids.
There will also be an option to search games by designers if the user takes a liking to a certain designer’s games.
It also allows the user to setup a profile, where they can record their own playsessions, who they’ve played with, and creating their own board game collection for easy access during search queries.
Target group is simply the growing population of people intrested in board games.
Because all the actual info is taken from boardgamegeek.com and all the games are intellectual property, there shall be no opportunity for making money with this app, it’s purely for convenience!
